When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    If you are collaborating with other workers, or if you yourself want to work from a different computer.
    
2. 
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because you might be collaborating with someone who doesn't want to be updated with your additions which might not be ready for use yet.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

	A fork is a copy of a repo on github.
	Use it when you want to edit a copy of the project online e.g. with collaborators. to maintain the reference to one who made it.
	A clone is a copy of a repo from online (remote) to your computer.
	Use it when you want to edit code yourself.
	A branch is a different version within the same repo.
	Use it when you want to create different versions of your project, but not necessarily combine them yet.
	
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

	Now, without access to the internet, you can import any changes from the updates that your collaborators made to the remote. Yet you don't have to incorporate them if you don't choose to merge the fetch.
